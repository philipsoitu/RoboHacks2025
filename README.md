## The Mount Royal Revival Project: An Autonomous Reforestation Mission

Autonomous robot to assist in reforestation efforts on Mount Royal. The goal is to navigate mapped terrain, identify suitable planting zones, and drop seeds only in designated areas, all while avoiding restricted
zones. The challenge simulates real-world reforestation efforts and encourages sustainable engineering.

## Mission Objectives
- Navigate autonomously through a marked area
- Identify correct planting zones using sensors
- Deposit seeds accurately in viable locations
- Avoid restricted areas to prevent ecological damage
- Optimize sustainability in materials, efficiency, and design
- Optional bonus: Visit the lake zone to simulate collecting environmental data

## Materials
- 2 Power Motors
- 1 Servo Motor
- 2 IR Sensors
- 2 Color Sensors
- 1 Arduino Nano
- 2 Wheels
- 1 Caster Wheel
- 9V rechargeable Battery
- Battery Connector
- 1 Breadboard
- Wires
- Optional: popsicle sticks
